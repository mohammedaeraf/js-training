## 📝 **Assignment 03: Control Structures**

### 🎯 Objective:

Understand and apply **conditional statements** (`if-else-if`, `switch-case`) and **looping** (`while` loop) using real-world-style problems.

### ✅ **Problem 1: Traffic Signal (if-else-if)**

**Task:**
Write a program that takes a **hardcoded traffic signal color** (as a string) and prints what action a driver should take.

```javascript
let signal = "yellow"; // Change this value to test
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Get Ready
```

**Logic:**

- `"red"` → Stop
- `"yellow"` → Get Ready
- `"green"` → Go
- Any other value → Invalid signal

---

### ✅ **Problem 2: Day of the Week (switch-case)**

**Task:**
Use a **hardcoded number** between 1 and 7. Use `switch-case` to print the corresponding day of the week.

```javascript
let dayNumber = 4; // Change this value to test
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Thursday
```

> If the number is outside 1–7, print: `Invalid day`

---

### ✅ **Problem 3: Countdown Timer (while loop)**

**Task:**
Use a **hardcoded number** to start a countdown using a `while` loop.

```javascript
let countdown = 5; // Change this value to test
```

**Expected Output:**

```
5
4
3
2
1
Blast off!
```

### 📌 **Instructions:**

- Run each program in **Node.js** (VS Code or terminal).
- Replace hardcoded values to test different scenarios.
- Use only the required control structure in each problem.
