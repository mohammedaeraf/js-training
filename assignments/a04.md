## 📝 Assignment 04: Loops and Number Logic

### 🎯 **Objective:**

Apply **loops**, **functions**, and basic **logic building** in JavaScript using `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops. Practice user interaction with `prompt()` and `alert()` functions.

---

### ✅ **Problem 1: Factorial of a Number**

**Task:**
Write a program to calculate the **factorial** of a hardcoded number using a `for` loop.

**Example:**

```javascript
let number = 5;
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Factorial of 5 is 120
```

> 💡 Hint: Use `for` loop and multiply numbers from 1 to `n`.

---

### ✅ **Problem 2: Fibonacci Series (n terms)**

**Task:**
Write a program to print the **first `n` numbers** in the Fibonacci series using a `while` loop. Use a hardcoded value for `n`.

**Example:**

```javascript
let n = 6;
```

**Expected Output:**

```
0 1 1 2 3 5
```

> 💡 Hint: First two numbers are 0 and 1. Each next number is the sum of previous two.

---

### ✅ **Problem 3: do-while Loop with `prompt()` and `alert()`**

**Task:**
Use a `do-while` loop to repeatedly ask the user:

> “Do you want to continue? (yes/no)”

Continue prompting the user until they enter `"no"`.
Use `prompt()` to get input and `alert()` to show a message.

> 💡 This works only in browsers, not Node.js.

**Expected Interaction:**

```
(alert) Welcome to the loop!
(prompt) Do you want to continue? (yes/no)
(alert) You chose to continue.
(prompt) Do you want to continue? (yes/no)
(alert) Exiting loop. Goodbye!
```
