## **ðŸ“˜ Assignment 07: `map()`, `filter()` functions**

### **Problem 01:**

You are given an array of **numbers**. Use the **`map()`** method to create a new array called **`modifiedNumbers`**, where:

- Each **even number** is multiplied by **2**.
- Each **odd number** is incremented by **1**.

---

**Sample Input:**

```jsx
const numbers = [4, 7, 12, 15, 9];

```

---

**Expected Output:**

```jsx
[8, 8, 24, 16, 10]

```

---

**Instructions:**

1. Use the **`map()`** function to iterate over the **`numbers`** array.
2. Inside the callback function, check if the current number is **even** or **odd**.
3. If the number is **even**, multiply it by **2**.
4. If the number is **odd**, increment it by **1**.
5. Store the resulting array in **`modifiedNumbers`**.
6. Print **`modifiedNumbers`** to the console.

---

### **Problem 02**

You are tasked with creating a program that filters out specific numbers from an array.

---

### **ðŸ“‹ Task Instructions**

1. **Create an Array of Numbers**
    - Create an array called **`numbers`** with the following values:
        
        ```jsx
        const numbers = [12, 5, 8, 130, 44, 3, 25, 60, 7, 90];
        
        ```
        
2. **Filter Out Even Numbers**
    - Use the **`filter()`** method to create a new array called **`evenNumbers`** that contains only the **even numbers** from the **`numbers`** array.
    - Print the **`evenNumbers`** array to the console.

---

### **ðŸŽ‰ Expected Output**

If you complete the task correctly, the final output might look like this:

```
Even Numbers: [12, 8, 130, 44, 60, 90]

```
